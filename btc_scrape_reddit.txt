Title: Which Bitcoin ETF should I buy that benefits Bitcoin the most?
Content: I've finally convinced my mom to buy Bitcoin with her IRA accounts, but I'm not sure which ETF she should buy, especially one that can benefit Bitcoin in the long run. I saw something like a 2x leveraged ETF such as BITX, and I feel like she shouldn't touch that. I would really appreciate any advice! Thank you.

Title: How to send BTC without being so transparent? 
Content: I'd like to send some BTC to someone. How can I do this without them tracing my transaction and ultimately seeing my amount in my wallet, and vice-versa? 

Do I have to get a new cold storage wallet and go to one of those kiosks in a random gas station to use fiat to purchase, then send that to my friend?

Thanks for suggestions. So far I've never sold nor moved money out from my cold storage. I really don't plan to, either, but eventually it'll happen.

I've read that it's best to keep in a offline wallet but, is it really necessary? If I do get a personal wallet, is the Trezor safe 3 on Amazon a good wallet? What else should I consider before investing in Bitcoin?

Is it secure to withdraw using Lightning Network to my cold storage wallet? I've read a few articles and it said Lightning nodes should be online. How about wallets? I'm planning to add my withdrawal adrresses on my online laptop as watch address.  

  
My cold storage idea: I've an unused laptop and planning to install a Linux Distro on it (Offline) and transfer Electrum Wallet (also offline) on it. I'll have paper back up (Seed) also I'll have USB drive wallet back up (encrypted with pw) &amp; Electrum SW.

Title: Just got my bits.
Content: I was busy with life but bitcoin kept asking for my attention so I raad about it. I am a dreamer, and I appreciate freedom. So I was convinced after doing some due diligence.

It does fit the vision for the next phase of human development. Just the idea that we can travel freely and be using a unified currency is just so good and so valid. Truth always wins! Because the limits of freedom that we have today are rooted in our own fears.. and thieves thrive of that fear, limiting our freedom more. Once we decide to get rid of them, we will live our full potential.

It so happened that the germans were selling giving me a good discount for entry.

It is also great to connect with like minded people. Because if you buy bitcoin because you believe in those values.. you believe in truth, goodness and oneness of humanity, then we are family.

Title: Volet former ADVCash freezing user funds - Be Aware
Content: Volet exchange, formerly ADVcash seems to block withdrawals of users. If you have an account there or funds there, maybe best to double check if you can withdraw them. Not your keys, not your coins - as always.

From Giacomo Zucco:

ALERT: [VoletCom](https://x.com/VoletCom) seems to be stealing user funds!  
  
Details:  
While I dislike and generally avoid KYC off-ramps, preferring p2p exchange whenever it's feasible, for reasons of convenience I did use this one on a few occasions. The first few transactions to fund a USD Mastercard went fine, but a few weeks ago their support desk refused to credit a couple of thousands USD worth of Bitcoin deposit, and they are currently refusing to give me back my money either. The "condition" they require, in order to return the loot, is an impossible chainanal challenge: giving them on-chain "proof of origin" of any single output involved in the tx graph of my funding transaction. My suspicion is that the "task" is intentionally designed to be impossible to comply with, in order to rug-pull users.   
  
I'll keep you updated in the coming weeks.

  
Peter Todd commented:  
"Why do you on the one hand claim giacomozucco's coins were "dirty", yet were happy to commingle them with other customer funds? Seem to me by your own standards you just put all your customers at risk with "dirty" coins...

Title: What is Your Opinion on Diversification?
Content: Hoping for another fun post. Do you only save/invest in Bitcoin or do you invest in other things as well? 

The pros of diversification are risk mitigation and allowing you bet on multiple things. If you think Bitcoin is risky and has a decent chance to go to zero you might diversify into less "risky" trades.

The cons are, well, being too diversified limits the benefit you receive from your convictions. You can't ride two horses with one ass. Most people I know who have made a lot of money invested in one or two things, not a basket of things. Sometimes investing takes a strong conviction.

I personally, and it is not advice, have been "undiversifying" from many assets to the ONE asset. I ride to zero or infinity.  

(Actually, I believe semiconductors will do well long term too so I may keep some money there, but the Coin is my big bet).


Anyways,curious to see what you guys do. There are no wrong answers! üëá

Title: Our brains are still attached to the very past
Content: Whenever I see Bitcoin's price drop, it's evident that many haven't grasped the full concept. By delving into Jeff Booth's insights, watching some of his interviews, you can realize we're still anchored to fiat currency paradigm. The shift in our mindset regarding money hasn't occurred yet.

I know a lot of people will reply me: "I use fiat everyday, I receive my wage in fiat... That's my reference!"... Ok ok... But, instead of thinking Bitcoin price is dropping, we should replace that by: US dollar is a little higher today so I can buy more sats. As my fiat currency increased today, I can exchange that for more real sound money! Money that cannot be created by pressing a button in a dark room full of old-minded people...

We are so attached to the Bitcoin priced in USD, that we just can't see the truth. Fear index now is high, when it   should obviously be the opposite.

So early...

Title: Digital currency, digital gold or digital baloney?
Content: I was watching some videos of Michael Saylor, and paid special attention to his "[21 Rules of Bitcoin"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PkMFIa7rmQ) keynote in Prague. All I could think was that Saylor's words were a profound departure from the founding myth of Bitcoin as being a digital currency. Saylor (trying to channel Jordan Peterson I suppose) just rolled out one incoherent "rule" after another that, IMHO, truly put the lie to Bitcoin being anything except a pure speculator asset being held aloft by incoherent myth-making.

Now, if your desire is simply to buy low and sell high... fine. What else does one do with an asset? But is anyone still truly under the spell that crypto is anything but hogwash meant to suck in enough actual, spendable money in order for a few people to get very rich? How do true-believers square the circle of the death of the Bitcoin-as-stateless-cash dream?

(1) The purchase should be through Debit or Credit Cards ; &amp;

Any help or guidance is appreciated.

Title: How many Bitcoiners in this Great Unemployment can stay solvent longer than the markets can stay irrational?
Content: I follow a few other subreddits that are about people being out of work. More and more are reporting it's not just about them but their industry itself. Even H-1B Indians are losing their American jobs to Indians in India. Many people are checking in with updates that it's been over a year with no luck finding new full time work. I'm concerned the runaway fiat printer that's keeping the economy askew will exhaust our stacked savings before this financial fever finally breaks.

Title: Selling pressure from old Bitcoins
Content: 

After today's CDD data, there was a slight drop following the entry of old Bitcoins into the exchange. Some of these are very old, while others are more recent. Although their quantities are not large, they can have an immediate impact on the markets.  
  
Looking at the intraday CDD data, with high values, I observed the following: 4% for 3-5 years, 8% for 2-3 years, 4% for 12-18 months, and 2% for 6-12 months. These have an immediate impact on the price. Sometimes there are more transfers, sometimes fewer. The remaining part mostly comes from intraday traders, which isn't very significant.  
  
When CDD data like this comes in alongside selling pressure, it must be evaluated.  
  
Summary: After the entry of old Bitcoins, there was a drop in Bitcoin. However, since their quantities are small, this selling pressure cannot last long and the price should recover shortly after the initial impact.

Title: Bitcoin Mining Metrics Suggest Bottom is Near 
Content: Bitoin‚Äôs hash rate, and therefore, miner difficulty, have both dropped considerably from their May all time highs (ATH). But these aren‚Äôt just arbitrary sets of data. Rather, they‚Äôre important metrics that give us insight on bitcoin‚Äôs price peaks and bottoms.¬†

And right now, the metrics are telling us that we might be close to a bottom. So, let‚Äôs break down the data and see what we can conclude about bitcoin‚Äôs current price levels.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/1j586w10k1cd1.png?width=1582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b8d1eec65c435b0d2fe4194e6242aecfc11b05

# Bitcoin‚Äôs Hash Rate, Miner Difficulty, and Price

Let‚Äôs first understand the relationship between bitcoin‚Äôs hash rate, miner difficulty, and price. Because these factors all influence each other.¬†

Hash rate measures the total amount of computing power and electricity that miners use to secure the network. Bitcoin‚Äôs difficulty adjustment is a hard-coded algorithm that makes it more or less difficult for miners to create new blocks.

So as bitcoin‚Äôs hash rate changes, the difficulty adjustment follows in the same direction. Satoshi designed the system this way to ensure that only one block would be created every 10 minutes.¬†

Now, bitcoin‚Äôs price matters here because it costs miners money to contribute computing power and electricity to the network. And the miners‚Äô rewards for this work is freshly mined bitcoin.¬†

Therefore, when price is high relative to hash rate and difficulty, times are good, miners are making money, and they‚Äôre able to HODL more bitcoin. But when price is low relative to these metrics, it puts the squeeze on miners, and forces them to sell off more bitcoin to pay the bills.¬†

# Miner Capitulation Signals Price Bottom¬†

So, the May ATHs in hash rate and difficulty, combined with April‚Äôs halving, explains why miners have been net sellers over the last few months.¬†

And this also explains why hash rate and difficulty adjustment have just now dropped from their ATHs by 11% and 10%, respectively. The economics are so rough that some miners are shutting off their machines.¬†

But it‚Äôs here where we find our silver lining in terms of price.¬†

The last time bitcoin had such a significant drop in hash rate and difficulty was late 2022, when FTX and major bitcoin miners were going bust. And this was also the time when bitcoin‚Äôs price bottomed just below $20K.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/bviwslbek1cd1.png?width=1349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2816231c2fd91e841464e8cbda5f25a0393ae705

And related to all of this is the Puell Multiple indicator, which focuses on bitcoin miner revenues.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/vm60vjafk1cd1.png?width=1486&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abbee7616ac3d0f7af69a4fd8b21f43664c2b694

Although the volatility in the Puell Multiple has been declining over time, what‚Äôs obvious is that when the multiple lands in the red zone, it often indicates a price top, with hits in the green zone indicating a price bottom.¬†

Currently, the Puell Multiple is getting dangerously close to the green.¬†

I hear the stories and been told, try and get as much as you can, but 0.35 BTC is great.

Please give great replies, as there are lots of new investors out there wanting to start, and feel that they have missed the BTC Boat.

Cheers.

Title: How can I buy Bitcoin with some caveats.
Content: I'm new to buying Bitcoin but known about it for a while so I'm familiar with it. I spent all day trying to figure out my problem and broke down made an account here to get some insight. So new to here too so sorry for any faux pas. 

I been buying bitcoin through ATMs mostly through LibertyX but the fees seem a bit much 10-15+%. I opened a coinbase account and used my debit card and the first transaction went through but not anymore so I tried using my bank account and that was a no go. I believe its my bank (I looked it up) I don't have a credit card so what do? I tried PayPal but same problem my bank. 

So what's a good bank to use on crypto exchanges, another way of adding $ to my coinbase account or a better way of buying bitcoin when I have no credit card. I just want to buy and put it on my hardware wallet (hodl) without the crazy fees compared to what coinbase fees are. Also I think my state is not so crypto friendly.

Title: Beware of bitsmtc
Content: 

Bitsmtc.com is a scam site. I lost $120 that I deposited, which got liquidated within 20 minutes without any significant change to the token I was trading against. Suddenly, I saw a -200% change, and all my funds were gone. This happened right after I completed the KYC process and informed them I wanted to make a withdrawal to test the platform before making a bigger deposit.

Additionally, my friend, who convinced me to use this platform, had deposited $100. Within a week, his wallet was holding over $9,000. He was able to make a small withdrawal of about $500, but three weeks later, his balance showed over $400,000. He then received an email claiming that he was now part of the Whale group and had to send a $45,000 tax charge to withdraw his funds. This sounds very scammy to me.

Title: Bitcoin and Mt Gox
Content: Years ago I had some Bitcoins stashed in MtGox.com. Then someone ran off with everyone‚Äôs bitcoins on that platform. 
At some point a law firm wrote me from Japan saying that they were looking for the coins, but due to that nature of crypto there wasn‚Äôt much hope. 
I believe a few years passed (I do have all the correspondence saved), I was notified that approximately 80% of the coins were somehow retrieved. 
I had purchased about $1,500 worth of Bitcoin originally, maybe $1,200 was stored in Mt Gox. 
I bought them when they were priced between $2.00 - $2.50 per coin. 
I had a total coin count of 700 to 800 coins, since I did have a few prior to my buying the $1,500 worth. 
The Japanese law firm, having recovered about 80% of the stolen coins, made me an offer of 0.11 Bitcoins total, saying that I had missed some notification deadline years prior. 
Do I have any options?

You al see what those idiots try to flex here?
Put the flex shown into AI to support local currencies value, that is what is really happening right now.
You're convinced or just a temporary believer in the hause? 
Nations are serious and understand their own currency is wanky in opposition to bitcoin.

Title: Will US sell their BTC?
Content: Since Germany started selling its bitcoin, I started checking bitcoin holdings per country. The 2 biggest are US and China. Initially I thought that was good, because this increases the chance that they embrace bitcoin. But since their bitcoin is seized from criminal activity, its not necessarily their plan to HODL. They maybe need to sell by law, not sure. What do you think? Will they sell their bitcoin? Or is there a chance they HODL it?

Title: How far should one go to be frugal and stack?
Content: I hope this is a fun post. I noticed a lot of people post about how they are skipping coffee, or wearing hand-me-downs, or driving a 27 year old car with no A/C, or eating ramen noodles to stack.

My question is how much is too far? For example, I am never going to sell my car and just take the bus. Would waste way too much time.  I'm not even gonna downgrade my car - I like leather seats and some power. Not shopping at a thrift store for clothes. Good fitting clothes makes you look more respectable and presentable socially. I am also not going to sacrifice my health - so eating Costco hotdogs or noodles instead of eggs, steaks, etc is off the table. Coffee? I dont drink it but I seriously don't think the 3 or 4 dollars a day max is gonna make that much of dent. I'll also drop whatever it takes on gym equipment if I feel it is needed. 

I guess for me it is important to live a normal daily healthy life while stacking. I don't  eat out or go out that much. I dont have expensive habits. Definitely not opening up a bottle of wine every night or even every month. Not going to drop big money on a night out. No clubs, bottle service etc. Rather have Bitcoin.

What's your line/limit? What are you willing to sacrifice (or not) just to save?
